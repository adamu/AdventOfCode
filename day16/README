Initial version. Will tidy up later.

Spent a bit too long on silly mistakes in this one. Think I need to consider my development
process to help avoid making errors.

Also, I'm finding these daily puzzles a bit too distracting from work. I think after today
I'm going to relegate them to the weekend. Doing them in the evenings has too much potential
to spill over into the next day.
