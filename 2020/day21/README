Not much to say about this problem. I didn't really enjoy it much.
I mostly just fiddled about with the data until it reduced down to the
required information.

The process of elimination - identifying the allergen with just 1 ingredient
and using that to decude the other options, was very similar identifying the tickets
in Day 16.
