Day 18 Notes

$ elixir day18part1.exs
<will add later>

Thoughts:
Since the order of precedence is the same, we can walk the token list, building up a left operand
and operator as we go, then applying the operator as soon as we get the right operand.  For groups,
use recursion to resolve the group, and push the result back onto the beginning of the token list.

| Part 2 |

$ elixir day18part2.exs

Thoughts:

Now the order of precedence is relevant, so can no longer just walk the token list, need to know the
full context.
Addition basically becomes implicit brackets.
Will do this part later.
