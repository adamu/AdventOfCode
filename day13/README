Day 13 Notes

<will add later>

Thoughts:

Pretty easy.
Filter out the x items, divide the current time by the bus ID, and the remainder is how many
minutes to wait. Take the minimum.

$ elixir day13part2.exs
*runs forever*

Thoughts:

Another one that's impossible to brute force. Currently stuck.
Have created a correct algorithm that produces the correct answer for the examples.
However, it will never complete for the real input.

There must be some other relationship that I'm missing. Maybe something to do with common factors?

Attempted to improve by starting with the multiple of all the ids and searching downwards, but
that doesn't complete either (I'm not interested in brute-force, so won't let it run for a long
time).

Wondering if the fact that three of the examples use the same IDs and differ only in offset
is important.

Going to come back to this later with a clear mind. Not sure I'll get it without a hint.
Seems like I have a knowledge gap.


+------------------+
| Overall Thoughts |
+------------------+

Doesn't really feel like a "coding" problem, because I implemented the algorithm but there's
obviously another trick. But will judge that once I know the answer.

Working out things from first principles is hard! But I think the thought process is more
valuable than just getting the right answer. So far I've been a bit competitive due to the
private leaderboards, but I guess that ends now.
