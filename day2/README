Thoughts:

Use a regex to parse the input
Huh, can't iterate a string with Enum. Split into a list with String.graphemes/1

Thoughts:

Convert indices to be zero-based.
No xor operator without importing Bitwise? Just write it manually.
Initially misread the problem - thought first position must match, and second position must not match,
which caused some confusion.
Probably rebound to the same variable names a bit too much - should work on clearer variable names.
